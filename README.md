Discrete Event Simulator - NUS ISE-BACC Competition

**Note: This repository is a work in progress and not yet complete.**

Discrete Event Simulator for a semiconductor factory. The simulator will simulate the flow of events and resources within the factory to optimize production and efficiency. This project is being developed for the NUS ISE-BACC Competition in order to find better algorithms.
